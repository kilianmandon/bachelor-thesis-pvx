Nevertheless, many other methods are available in the literature for the 3D case. This article reviews the most representative ones, proposes alternative ones, and presents a comparative analysis to elucidate their relative computational costs and error performances. This analysis leads to the conclusion that some algebraic closed-form methods are as robust as the SVD, but significantly faster and more accurate.},

abstract = {Although deep learning has revolutionized protein structure prediction, almost all experimentally characterized de novo protein designs have been generated using physically based approaches such as Rosetta. Here, we describe a deep learning-based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4\% compared with 32.9\% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins. Deep learning approaches such as Alphafold and Rosettafold have made reliable protein structure prediction broadly accessible. For the inverse problem, finding a sequence that folds to a desired structure, most approaches remain based on energy optimization. In two papers, a range of protein design problems were addressed through deep learning methods. Dauparas et al. built on recent deep learning protein design approaches to develop a method called ProteinMPNN. They validated designs experimentally and showed that ProteinMPNN can rescue previously failed designs made using Rosetta or Alphafold. Wicky et al. started from a random sequence and used Monte Carlo sequence search coupled with structure prediction by Alphafold to design cyclic homo-oligomers. Although the designs were generated to achieve stable expression, the sequences had to be regenerated using ProteinMPNN. This approach allowed for the design of a range of experimentally validated cyclic oligomers and paves the way for the design of increasingly complex assemblies. —VV A network-based protein design enables the generation of cyclic homo-oligomers across the nanoscopic scale.}}


@article{RFdiffusion,
	abstract = {There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep-learning methods1--9. Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence--structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.},

Internal and 5' terminal deletions of the 5'-nontranslated region of PVX RNA were assessed for their effects on formation of assembled virus-like particles (VLPs). Mutant RNAs that contain the top region of SL1 or sequences therein bound to CP to form VLPs. In contrast, transcripts of mutants that disrupt SL1 RNA structure were unable to form VLPs. SELEX was used to further confirm the specific RNA recognition of PVX CP using RNA transcripts containing randomized sequences of the upper portion of SL1. Wild-type (wt) sequences along with many other sequences that resemble SL1 structure were selected after fourth and fifth rounds of SELEX (27.0\% and 44.4\%, respectively). RNA transcripts from several SELEX winners that are predicted to form stable stem-loop structures very closely resembling wt PVX SL1 formed VLPs. RNA transcripts not predicted to form secondary structures similar to SL1 did not form VLPs in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that RNA secondary structural elements within SL1 and/or sequences therein are crucial for formation of VLPs and are required for the specific recognition by the CP subunit.}

With the aim of exploiting this virus to display peptides useful for vaccine formulations, two novel viral expression vectors based on pPVX201 (bearing the wild-type PVX genome) were constructed encoding the truncated CP. Both vectors were able to produce infectious virus particles in planta and were used to insert a panel of sequences encoding peptides of biopharmaceutical interest as N-terminal fusions to the truncated cp gene. The analysis of infection progression induced by the different constructs enabled identification of two important structural features of the fused peptide, namely tryptophan content and isoelectric point, critically affecting the formation of PVX CVPs and virus movement through the plant. These results are discussed in view of the rising interest in engineered plant viruses for development of peptide-based epitope vaccines.",

To clarify this issue, we studied the infection progression of a mutant carrying an N-terminal deletion of the coat protein, which was used to construct chimeric virus particles displaying peptides selectively affecting phloem transfer or cell-to-cell movement. Nicotiana benthamiana plants inoculated with expression vectors encoding the wild-type, mutant and chimeric viral genomes were examined by microscopy techniques. These experiments showed that coat protein–peptide fusions promoting cell-to-cell transfer only were not competent for virion assembly, whereas long-distance movement was possible only for coat proteins compatible with virus particle formation. Moreover, the ability of the assembled PVX to enter and persist into developing xylem elements was revealed here for the first time.},

Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder--target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein--protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Virus-like particles (VLPs) are nanostructures assemble from viral proteins. Besides widely used for vaccine development, VLPs have also been explored as nanocarriers for cargo delivery as they combine the key advantages of viral and non-viral vectors. While it protects cargo molecules from degradation, the VLP has good cell penetrating property to mediate cargo passing the cell membrane and released into cells, making the VLP an ideal tool for intracellular delivery of biomolecules and drugs. Great progresses have been achieved and multiple challenges are still on the way for broad applications of VLP as delivery vectors. Here we summarize current advances and applications in VLP as a delivery vector. Progresses on delivery of different types of biomolecules as well as drugs by VLPs are introduced, and the strategies for cargo packaging are highlighted which is one of the key steps for VLP mediated intracellular delivery. Production and applications of VLPs are also briefly reviewed, with a discussion on future challenges in this rapidly developing field.},

	abstract = {Virus-like particles (VLPs) are virus-derived structures made up of one or more different molecules with the ability to self-assemble, mimicking the form and size of a virus particle but lacking the genetic material so they are not capable of infecting the host cell. Expression and self-assembly of the viral structural proteins can take place in various living or cell-free expression systems after which the viral structures can be assembled and reconstructed. VLPs are gaining in popularity in the field of preventive medicine and to date, a wide range of VLP-based candidate vaccines have been developed for immunization against various infectious agents, the latest of which is the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of which is being evaluated. VLPs are highly immunogenic and are able to elicit both the antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses by pathways different from those elicited by conventional inactivated viral vaccines. However, there are still many challenges to this surface display system that need to be addressed in the future. VLPs that are classified as subunit vaccines are subdivided into enveloped and non- enveloped subtypes both of which are discussed in this review article. VLPs have also recently received attention for their successful applications in targeted drug delivery and for use in gene therapy. The development of more effective and targeted forms of VLP by modification of the surface of the particles in such a way that they can be introduced into specific cells or tissues or increase their half-life in the host is likely to expand their use in the future. Recent advances in the production and fabrication of VLPs including the exploration of different types of expression systems for their development, as well as their applications as vaccines in the prevention of infectious diseases and cancers resulting from their interaction with, and mechanism of activation of, the humoral and cellular immune systems are discussed in this review.},

	abstract = {Virus-like particles (VLPs) have become key tools in biology, medicine and even engineering. After their initial use to resolve viral structures at the atomic level, VLPs were rapidly harnessed to develop antiviral vaccines followed by their use as display platforms to generate any kind of vaccine. Most recently, VLPs have been employed as nanomachines to deliver pharmaceutically active products to specific sites and into specific cells in the body. Here, we focus on the use of VLPs for the development of vaccines with broad fields of indications ranging from classical vaccines against viruses to therapeutic vaccines against chronic inflammation, pain, allergy and cancer. In this review, we take a walk through time, starting with the latest developments in experimental preclinical VLP-based vaccines and ending with marketed vaccines, which earn billions of dollars every year, paving the way for the next wave of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines already visible on the horizon.},

ABSTRACT={Nanotechnology is an expanding interdisciplinary field concerning the development and application of nanostructured materials derived from inorganic compounds or organic polymers and peptides. Among these latter materials, proteinaceous plant virus nanoparticles have emerged as a key platform for the introduction of tailored functionalities by genetic engineering and conjugation chemistry. Tobacco mosaic virus and Cowpea mosaic virus have already been developed for bioimaging, vaccination and electronics applications, but the flexible and filamentous Potato virus X (PVX) has received comparatively little attention. The filamentous structure of PVX particles allows them to carry large payloads, which are advantageous for applications such as biomedical imaging in which multi-functional scaffolds with a high aspect ratio are required. In this context, PVX achieves superior tumor homing and retention properties compared to spherical nanoparticles. Because PVX is a protein-based nanoparticle, its unique functional properties are combined with enhanced biocompatibility, making it much more suitable for biomedical applications than synthetic nanomaterials. Moreover, PVX nanoparticles have very low toxicity in vivo, and superior pharmacokinetic profiles. This review focuses on the production of PVX nanoparticles engineered using chemical and/or biological techniques, and describes current and future opportunities and challenges for the application of PVX nanoparticles in medicine, diagnostics, materials science and biocatalysis.}}

	abstract = {Eukaryotic cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems have the potential to simplify and speed up the expression and high-throughput analysis of complex proteins with functionally relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs). However, low yields and the inability to scale such systems have so far prevented their widespread adoption in protein research and manufacturing.Here, we present a detailed demonstration for the capabilities of a CFPS system derived from Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 cell culture (BY-2 lysate; BYL). BYL is able to express diverse, functional proteins at high yields in under 48 hours, complete with native disulfide bonds and N-glycosylation. An optimised version of the technology is commercialised as {\textquoteleft}ALiCE{\textregistered}{\textquoteright}, engineered for high yields of up to 3 mg/mL. Recent advances in the scaling of BYL production methodologies have allowed scaling of the CFPS reaction. We show simple, linear scale-up of batch mode reporter proten expression from a 100 μL microtiter plate format to 10 mL and 100 mL volumes in standard Erlenmeyer flasks, culminating in preliminary data from 1 L reactions in a CELL-tainer{\textregistered} CT20 rocking motion bioreactor. As such, these works represent the first published example of a eukaryotic CFPS reaction scaled past the 10 mL level by several orders of magnitude.We show the ability of BYL to produce the simple reporter protein eYFP and large, multimeric virus-like particles directly in the cytosolic fraction. Complex proteins are processed using the native microsomes of BYL and functional expression of multiple classes of complex, difficult-to-express proteins is demonstrated, specifically: a dimeric, glycoprotein enzyme, glucose oxidase; the monoclonal antibody adalimumab; the SARS-Cov-2 receptor-binding domain; human epidermal growth factor; and a G protein-coupled receptor membrane protein, cannabinoid receptor type 2. Functional binding and activity are shown using a combination of surface plasmon resonance techniques, a serology-based ELISA method and a G protein activation assay. Finally, in-depth post-translational modification (PTM) characterisation of purified proteins through disulfide bond and N-glycan analysis is also revealed - previously difficult in the eukaryotic CFPS space due to limitations in reaction volumes and yields.Taken together, BYL provides a real opportunity for screening of complex proteins at the microscale with subsequent amplification to manufacturing-ready levels using off-the-shelf protocols. This end-to-end platform suggests the potential to significantly reduce cost and the time-to-market for high value proteins and biologics.Competing Interest StatementMDG, YF, RR, HJ, JAG, FA, JH, ZAA, JN, CW and RF were employed by LenioBio GmbH at the time of their contributions.

abstract = {Abstract Taxonomy Potato virus X is the type-member of the plant-infecting Potexvirus genus in the family Alphaflexiviridae. Physical properties Potato virus X (PVX) virions are flexuous filaments 460–480 nm in length. Virions are 13 nm in diameter and have a helical pitch of 3.4 nm. The genome is approximately 6.4 kb with a 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) terminus. PVX contains five open reading frames, four of which are essential for cell-to-cell and systemic movement. One protein encodes the viral replicase. Cellular inclusions, known as X-bodies, occur near the nucleus of virus-infected cells. Hosts The primary host is potato, but it infects a wide range of dicots. Diagnostic hosts include Datura stramonium and Nicotiana tabacum. PVX is transmitted in nature by mechanical contact.
