abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is the standard method of choice for solving the nearest rotation matrix problem. Nevertheless, many other methods are available in the literature for the 3D case. This article reviews the most representative ones, proposes alternative ones, and presents a comparative analysis to elucidate their relative computational costs and error performances. This analysis leads to the conclusion that some algebraic closed-form methods are as robust as the SVD, but significantly faster and more accurate.},

abstract = {Abstract Advances in computational tools for atomic model building are leading to accurate models of large molecular assemblies seen in electron microscopy, often at challenging resolutions of 3–4 Å. We describe new methods in the UCSF ChimeraX molecular modeling package that take advantage of machine-learning structure predictions, provide likelihood-based fitting in maps, and compute per-residue scores to identify modeling errors. Additional model-building tools assist analysis of mutations, post-translational modifications, and interactions with ligands. We present the latest ChimeraX model-building capabilities, including several community-developed extensions.

abstract = {Although deep learning has revolutionized protein structure prediction, almost all experimentally characterized de novo protein designs have been generated using physically based approaches such as Rosetta. Here, we describe a deep learning–based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4\% compared with 32.9\% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo–electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins. Deep learning approaches such as Alphafold and Rosettafold have made reliable protein structure prediction broadly accessible. For the inverse problem, finding a sequence that folds to a desired structure, most approaches remain based on energy optimization. In two papers, a range of protein design problems were addressed through deep learning methods. Dauparas et al. built on recent deep learning protein design approaches to develop a method called ProteinMPNN. They validated designs experimentally and showed that ProteinMPNN can rescue previously failed designs made using Rosetta or Alphafold. Wicky et al. started from a random sequence and used Monte Carlo sequence search coupled with structure prediction by Alphafold to design cyclic homo-oligomers. Although the designs were generated to achieve stable expression, the sequences had to be regenerated using ProteinMPNN. This approach allowed for the design of a range of experimentally validated cyclic oligomers and paves the way for the design of increasingly complex assemblies. —VV A network-based protein design enables the generation of cyclic homo-oligomers across the nanoscopic scale.}}


@article{RFdiffusion,
	abstract = {There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep-learning methods1--9. Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence--structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.},

@article{binder_design,
	abstract = {Recently it has become possible to de novo design high affinity protein binding proteins from target structural information alone. There is, however, considerable room for improvement as the overall design success rate is low. Here, we explore the augmentation of energy-based protein binder design using deep learning. We find that using AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold to assess the probability that a designed sequence adopts the designed monomer structure, and the probability that this structure binds the target as designed, increases design success rates nearly 10-fold. We find further that sequence design using ProteinMPNN rather than Rosetta considerably increases computational efficiency.},

Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein--ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein--nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody--antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep-learning framework.},
