ProteinMPNN \cite{PMPNN2022} is a deep learning model for protein sequence design, capable of creating de-novo designs of proteins that fold into a desired shape or bind to specific targets. The algorithm can create sequences for monomers, heterooligomers, and homooligomers. 

The sequence is designed based on a protein backbone as input, that is the position of all backbone atoms of one or multiple chains. The underlying algorithm uses a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN), a graph-based machine learning model. Each residue in the protein is encoded as a vertex in the graph, and edges are drawn up from each residue to its 48 closest neighbours.
